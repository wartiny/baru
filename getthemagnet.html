<h2 class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">Get The Magnet</h2>
<p class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">Walk over to the right and up the slant of the roof until you can jump onto the tippity&nbsp;top. Turn to the left and aim yourself diagonally at the fenced off area located down below. If you're worried that you're heading in the wrong direction, you can watch out video guide below which shows what we're talking about. Slide towards the fenced off area with your umbrella open and you should have an easy time landing on it.</p>
<p class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">Use the mannequin to break the window and jump through it. There will be a hole in the ground of this room so go through that. You&rsquo;ll end up in another room where you&rsquo;ll find an opening stuffed with cabinets. Look there to get the magnet.</p>
