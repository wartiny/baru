<h2 style="text-align: center;">Tips and Tricks</h2>
<p>&nbsp;A beautiful game, the number of students in the game can be changed from a few to the max before entering the game. One of the main reasons that we myself come back to this amazing game is the limitless options available, along with the ability to edit the game from the weather to what the characters say.</p>
<ul>
<li>Play the game the way&nbsp;<strong>You</strong>&nbsp;want, leaving the gaming experience in your hands.</li>
<li>Be a&nbsp;<strong>peacemaker</strong>&nbsp;or cause&nbsp;<strong>mayhem</strong>&nbsp;at your own whim.</li>
<li>Become the&nbsp;<strong>popular</strong>&nbsp;student you&rsquo;ve always wanted to be or become the&nbsp;<strong>outcast</strong>. Even become the most hated by many.</li>
<li>Choose your lover, once chosen they stay your lover unless you make them hate you. Even make your other playable character your lover</li>
</ul>
<p>The options are almost endless, so play as&nbsp;<strong>you</strong>&nbsp;choose. And since this game&nbsp;<strong>doesn&rsquo;t</strong>&nbsp;show&nbsp;<strong>blood</strong>, this game is perfect for&nbsp;<strong>younger</strong>&nbsp;audiences. Choose your path and set forward on the mission of your choosing. Who knows, you might just get as attached to this game as we are.</p>
