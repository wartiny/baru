<h3 style="text-align: center;">Defeat the leader of the Yakuza</h3>
<p>What to cause some mayhem? Go to the&nbsp;<strong>Yakuza office</strong>&nbsp;(there are two men wearing black clothes walking outside it). Kill all the members, and go up to the two-door and kill the other members. Then to the doors on your left and kill the leader. You will find in the building&nbsp;<strong>4guns, 1 sword</strong>, and<strong>&nbsp;7000 yen</strong>. Also remember that if you don&rsquo;t kill the members, or even die, they will keep following and attacking.&nbsp;</p>
