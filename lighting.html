<h1>Lighting</h1>
<p>Now after completion of Section 3 you are ready to add Lighting into the room&hellip;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />For now im going to add a Floodlight into the room&hellip;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />For Lighting purposes Floodlights are kinda unique because you can use them in two ways!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />1. A Sun-Ray effect<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Or<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />2. Scenic Value<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />For now im going to stick to option 2 for this tutorial!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />So<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Pause everything and add the Floodlight to the room</p>
<p>After that freeze the Floodlight and move on to Section 5&hellip;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>OPTIONAL:</strong><br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />If you want you can add Cathode lights or Light bulbs into the room.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Cathode lights:</strong>&nbsp;If you want a fair amount of light you can add these into the room<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br /><strong>Light bulbs:</strong>&nbsp;If you want a large amount of light you can add these into the room<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />Once you have selected a light you are going to want to pause time and place it some where that<br />&nbsp;<br />isn&rsquo;t visible in the room so that only the light is visible and not the model.</p>
