<p>Initially, when you will download the game, it will show you an alert from the Play store as it is a Virus. But this is not a virus. As the game is designed for adults, therefore, it violates the rules of the Play Store. So, you are supposed to ignore that alert and install or play the game.</p>
<p>I have provided the Zip file where you will get the Apk file. So, you are supposed to download the Zip file from this page and Unzip that to install it on your Android phones. Once you will Unzip the file, you will get the Apk file of the game.</p>
<p>Simply click on that file and install that on your phone. After that, you need to launch on your devices. There it will ask you to go through a human verification where you are supposed to install two apps. You can also get different tasks rather than the installation of two apps or games.</p>
