<h3 style="text-align: center;">Earning money</h3>
<p>You also don&rsquo;t have to talk to NPCs to find money, simply exploring the town, you can find it just laying around. There is also money in the&nbsp;<strong>girl&rsquo;s house, the boy&rsquo;s house,&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;the little kid&rsquo;s house.</strong>&nbsp;Keep an eye out while you&rsquo;re flying around or you&rsquo;re bound to miss it.</p>
