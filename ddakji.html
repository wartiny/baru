<h2>Ddakji</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not technically a round in the tournament, but it&rsquo;s certainly the gateway drug into the competition, with Seong Gi-hun and the rest of the contestants lured into the game by a wealthy businessman.</p>
<p>The card-flipping game, known as Ddakji, is a traditional Korean game popular with children. Not dissimilar to pogs, the aim of the game is to throw your card in a manner that flips your opponent&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Unlike in Game of Squid, which sees the winner win petty cash (or a slap in the face), should you flip your opponent&rsquo;s card in real life you get to keep said card.</p>
