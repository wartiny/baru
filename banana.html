<h3>STEP 1: BANANA SMOOTHIE INGREDIENTS &ndash; ONLY 5 INGREDIENTS</h3>
<p>Measure out all of the ingredients for this banana smoothie before throwing all of the ingredients into the blender.</p>
<ol>
<li>Bananas</li>
<li>Greek Yogurt</li>
<li>Almond Milk</li>
<li>Flax Meal</li>
<li>Vanilla Extract</li>
</ol>
<h4>STEP 2: BLEND BANANA SMOOTHIE IN A BLENDER</h4>
<p>We love our&nbsp;Vitamix, but any blender will work to blend this healthy smoothie to creamy perfection! Now, remember that this banana smoothie can be as thin or as thick as you want it.</p>
<p>If you like your smoothies a bit thinner, try adding extra almond milk. If you like thick and creamy omit some of the almond milk.</p>
<p><strong>STEP 3: ADD TOPPINGS TO YOUR SMOOTHIE</strong></p>
<p>Go big home when it comes to smoothie toppings! Our favorite smoothie toppings are nut butter, granola, hemp seeds, and slices of fresh fruit!</p>
