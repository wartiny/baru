<h2><strong>Tips to Win at the Game Party</strong></h2>
<p>Play Together has 17 fun mini&nbsp;games that are similar to Fall Guys.&nbsp;To access these games, tap the smartphone on the right side of the screen &gt; Game Party. You can also play them by entering the &ldquo;Game Zone&rdquo; building in the plaza (Kaia Island).</p>
<p>All are multiplayer games that require at least 30 players to begin with.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">Games are randomly chosen for all players and are grouped into &ldquo;rounds&rdquo;. Each game has a timer and players who reach the finish line or complete a goal by avoiding all obstacles before the timer hits 0 move to the next round.</p>
<p>Defeated players are removed from the list of 30 players once the game ends. The rest compete against each other in the next round, which could be more challenging than the previous one.&nbsp; This continues until the last one standing wins the game and obtains lots of stars and crowns. Defeated players also get some stars based on their performance. They can start afresh and try to survive another set of games.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of games and a few tips to survive until the end:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Descend:</strong>&nbsp;In a hexagon tower, players will have to find a way down to arrive at the bottom floor first. Each floor on the tower has a hole. You will have to find a hole to descend until you reach the bottom-most floor of the tower.</p>
<p>First get the top view of the floor by dragging your finger forward. This way you will get a clear view of it.</p>
<p>Next, be in a group and follow your group. You will find a hole much faster if you follow a group of players wherever they go.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Speed Racing:</strong>&nbsp;One of the most challenging games. Players will have to get to the finish line faster than anyone else.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">Since you will have to jump from one platform to another, timing is very important. The game helps you by placing &ldquo;Jump&rdquo; signboards at crucial junctures, giving you hints on when to jump.</p>

<div id="content_8_btf_wrapper" class="adunitwrapper content_btf_wrapper mv-size-336x280" data-wrapper="content_8_btf" data-nosnippet="">
<div id="content_8_btf" class="content_btf adunit" data-google-query-id="CP_1u9KNqPMCFUxHjwodmRwPfQ">
<p>There are various versions of speed racing &ndash; desert, cloud etc. In cloud racing, the gap between platforms is covered by clouds, so you will have to jump at the right time whenever you see clouds in front of you. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Run the Wall:</strong>&nbsp;The game is much like Takeshi&rsquo;s Castle, but simple.</p>
<p>In Run the Wall, you and 29 other players have to run on narrow lanes filled with obstacles. The setting and design is inspired by the Great Wall of China. Follow the path and reach the finish line before others do to move to the next round.</p>
<p>Pay attention to red and blue arrows on the lanes. Running over red arrows will speed up movement, whereas blue arrows will slow you down.</p>
<p>If you are stuck at a stationary obstacle, then just move away from it. Don&rsquo;t try to jump over it.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Hot Potato:&nbsp;</strong>One of the easiest and most entertaining mini games. You and 29 other players will be dropped in a stadium. Players will have to pass the bomb to others and run away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the shortest of all games and roughly divided into 3 rounds. In each round, a bomb is dropped on a random player. You will notice a player&rsquo;s head changed into a ticking cannon ball. The player has to move near another player to pass that bomb. He has to do this before the start of next round. If he fails to do this after the ticking countdown timer, he is out of the game.</p>
<p data-slot-rendered-dynamic="true">If a bomb is dropped onto your character or passed on to you, then quickly move your character to a group of players. You will pass on to the bomb to one of them who comes into your contact. Don&rsquo;t chase individual players running away from you. In panic mode, people tend to run in groups. Take advantage of this.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Rotating Logs:&nbsp;</strong>In this game, players will have to avoid the rotating log on the top of the cliff and survive.</p>
<p>There will be two rotating logs, you will have to avoid the bottom thinner/spiky log. A good strategy would be to stand closer to the base of the big log and follow the spiky log. Keep it slow and steady. Don&rsquo;t run away from it, follow it in the same direction.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;<strong>Obstacle Race 01:&nbsp;</strong>This is a platformer game with blocks that float up and down, meaning you will have to jump from one platform to another and even walk on narrow lanes.</p>
<p>In Obstacle Race 01, reaching the finish line can be pretty tough and very few can reach them. You shouldn&rsquo;t rush when you jump from one platform to another. No running here. Be slow when you are jumping from one platform to another, also when walking on narrow lanes.</p>
