<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Tips &amp; Tricks</strong></h3>
<p>After you have accepted the task, you have 3 minutes to put out 16 fires. However, it is difficult to reach the external fires through the trees, as you can hardly get through with the tank. The route works best within the base itself. To do this, you should clear the fences out of the way beforehand so that you have the greatest possible freedom of movement with the vehicle. Also, do not accelerate too much with the tank, otherwise you will pass the fires too quickly. You only have one attempt a day at 11 a.m. Therefore, prepare the best route beforehand.</p>
