<h3 style="text-align: center;">5. Stay Close To Your Squad</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sausage Man lets you engage in a match on your own, with a partner, or with a full squad with 3 other people. There are always advantages and disadvantages to any of the choices and then, there is also a matter of whether you are playing with friends or random people. Naturally, it all boils down to coordination and cooperation, which typically dwindles the more people there are and the more random players you pair up with.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Having a reliable set of friends, or people you actually know has its advantages but this should not stop you from competing with a squad of random players. Sausage Man actually makes it easy enough for each member of the squad to communicate and coordinate with one another and, beyond that, playing well enough with random players will naturally lead you to acquiring more friends you can subsequently pair up with.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">To start off, you can select a drop tactic at the mode select screen, indicating your preferences that will lead to you being paired up with like-minded people. You can go for a hot drop, a safe drop, or no tactics. Keep in mind that you can also choose a specific map on this area as well as whether to go solo, duo, or quad as far as team members are concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">It all starts right from the drop off and while there will be a random drop leader, it can happen that a full squad of random players will wind up jumping at different times. Regardless of what happens, you should always make an effort to get back to your team as no advantage will ever come out of being far and away from your fellow team members.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full">In this regard, do not shy away from placing markers on the mini map. If you feel that you and your squad need to meet up on a certain area and in the absence of a leader, you can always place a marker along with some communication if necessary to drive the entire squad to come together.</figure>

<p style="text-align: center;">Having encounters with a full squad can be dangerous enough even if it is a 4-on-4 engagement. Being separated from your team and being forced to engage enemies will seriously put you at a disadvantage if you are alone, even more if you are a beginner.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">As a beginner as well, staying with more experienced squad members can lead you to many discoveries such as areas you may not discover on your own as well as extra loot chances to pick up if they kill an opponent close by.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Another discrete advantage comes when you or your fellow squad member has been downed. Being downed means you can still be recovered by a teammate and you can do the same for each of your fellow squad members as well. Downed players are very vulnerable, though, and an extra shot on them and they are out of the game.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Despite not being able to readily tell if your random teammates are more experienced or less experienced than you, sticking with them will give you a plethora of opportunities to learn from each of them. You can learn from the more experienced ones on what to do and, in contrast, learn from the fellow beginners what not to do. For beginners, we also recommend that you stay behind your team. In case of an engagement, being behind leaves a better chance of survival especially if you are moving forward.</p>
