<h2 class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">Climb The Elevator Shaft</h2>
<p class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">Once you've opened the elevator doors, get past your neighbor and into his house.&nbsp;If you didn&rsquo;t grab the umbrella we mentioned before, now is your chance.&nbsp;You might notice the basement door with the exit sign hanging over it but don't worry about that right now. Just know that you'll need a key card and a crowbar to open it.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">Run down the hall and straight towards the back of the house through the right side. Head directly into the elevator shaft and use the ladder on the left to&nbsp;start climbing until you see an opening. Jump into the opening. There should be a generator there. Press the button to turn it off.</p>
<p class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">Go down the steps and through the door on the ground. You&rsquo;ll end up on the roof of the house. Bring out the umbrella and open it because if you fall from this height, you&rsquo;ll have to start all over again.</p>
