<h2>Tug of War</h2>
<p>A game that&rsquo;s familiar to most of the audience (and only really scary if you hate physical exercise), tug of war sees players split into two teams. One team of players holds one end of a large braided rope while the other team holds the opposite side of said rope.</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to overpower the opposing team by pulling on the rope at the same time, dragging them across the dividing line drawn in the centre between the two.</p>
<p>Naturally, in Squid Game the game curators have upped the ante and given the Sports Day favourite a deadly twist.</p>
<p>Participants are chained to the rope, and stand on large platforms over a large, steep drop. If a team is overpowered and loses, they fall into this canyon, right before a guillotine chops the rope in half, sending them plummeting to their imminent death.</p>
<p>In Squid Game, the&nbsp;Old Man&nbsp;had a couple of clever tricks up his sleeve to ensure he won this game.</p>
