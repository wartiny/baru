<p style="text-align: center;">If you started the game recently, you might believe that the best way to shoot a powerful shot is by spamming the boost button in front of the ball. Even though that works very well, it is common among amateur players and some seasoned players occasionally do this. However, if you want powerful shots, you should ideally get as close to the ball as you can and then do a flip. The flip will launch the ball with a powerful thrust in the direction you are pointing to.</p>
