<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Dalgona candy History</strong></h2>
<p>Dalgona (달고나) or ppopgi (뽑기) is a Korean candy made with melted sugar and baking soda. It was a popular street snack in the 1970s and 1980s, and is still eaten as a retro food.Dalgona was originally a term specific for pricey honeycomb toffees that use glucose which did not use a mold, while ppopgi was originally honeycomb toffees that use sugar and thus could be easily molded into shapes such as stars and circles. Due to problems with dalgona regarding its susceptibility to mould, the word dalgona began to refer to the same food as ppopgi. It has a different name in each region, being called ttigi (띠기) in Chungcheong Province, gukja (국자, "ladle"), ttonggwaja (똥과자, literally "poop cookie") or pajjakung (파짜꿍) in North Gyeongsang Province including Daegu, jjokja (쪽자) near South Gyeongsang Province and Busan, olittegi/olittigi (오리떼기/오리띠기) in Masan, and ttegi (떼기) in Jeju. When a pinch of baking soda is mixed into melted sugar, the thermal decomposition of the baking soda releases carbon dioxide, which makes the liquidized sugar puff up, and it becomes a light and crunchy candy once cooled and hardened. Typically, the creamy beige liquid is poured on a flat surface, pressed flat, and stamped with a patterned mold. Eaters try to trim their way around the outline or picture on the snack without breaking the picture. If the trimming is completed successfully without breaking the candy, the consumer receives another free dalgona.</p>
