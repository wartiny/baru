The way it shrinks will be random, which means that the final stretch of the match can take place in many different areas of the map. How the safe zone shrinks is not instant. There will be a countdown on intervals, and the actual shrinking takes time as well. With the shrinking safe zone being a constant in every match, you should always be a step ahead of it and likewise be prepared to beat it in case it cuts to close to where you are situated.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">In contrast with seeing the concept of the shrinking safe zone as a peril to you and all other players, it also presents plenty of opportunities for you if you strategize around the concept. Although the behavior by which the safe zone shrinks is unpredictable, there are ways to assume a stage earlier as to which areas will most likely be safe after the next shrink.</p>
