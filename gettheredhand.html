<h2>Get the Red Hand</h2>
<p>Head forward through this room past the Yellow VCR and go up the stairs onto the catwalk. On the catwalk walk forward until you reach a control panel. Next to the control panel is a&nbsp;<strong>Blue Fuse</strong>&nbsp;on the ground and a gap in the railing. Grab the fuse and place it into the control panel then drop down to the floor below using the gap in the railing.</p>
<p>In the room below you need to find the three additional fuses. These fuses appear to be randomly spawned into the room. Just be thorough in looking through the room to find them they are usually on the floor or on the shelves. Once you have all three fuses return to the control panel and place them. The factory will come to life and the crane will bring the Red hand to the conveyor belt below. When it is available go down to the item and grab it to equip it on your right hand.</p>
