<h4><strong><em>Accidental deletion:&nbsp;</em></strong></h4>
<p>Human error is a leading cause of data loss. Unintentional deletion of files or formatting an SD card without proper backup can lead to permanent data loss.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Formatting:&nbsp;</em></strong></h4>
<p>Formatting erases all data on an SD card to prepare it for use with a specific device or file system. While sometimes necessary, accidental formatting can cause significant data loss.</p>
<h4><strong><em>Corruption:&nbsp;</em></strong></h4>
<p>SD cards can corrupt for various reasons, such as power surges, unexpected device removal, or physical damage. This corruption can render the data inaccessible or even permanently damaged.</p>
