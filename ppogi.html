<h2>Ppopgi</h2>
<p>The second round is the honeycomb game. The snack is made by mixing a small quantity of baking soda with sugar, making a light and crunchy candy.</p>
<p>When it is still cooling, it is usually pressed flat and stamped with a light, patterned mould.</p>
<p>When purchasing the candy as a street food, eaters try to trim their way around the outline on the snack without breaking the picture. If they are successful, they receive a second ppopgi for free.</p>
<p>The street food was most popular in South Korea in the 1970s and 80s, but has enjoyed a bit of a renaissance in recent weeks due to Game of Squid&rsquo;s popularity.</p>
<p>What makes Game of Squid&rsquo;s version of the game all the more terrifying (apart from the gun being pointed to your head) is removing the shape from the rest of the honeycomb. While several players try in desperation to chisel their honeycomb shapes out with a toothpick provided to each player, Seong Gi-hun and a select few remaining players devise a more ingenious solution to the game.</p>
