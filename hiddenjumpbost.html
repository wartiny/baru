<p style="text-align: center;">When you start the game on a new account as a complete beginner, you will see only two action buttons on your screen apart from the joystick. The&nbsp;<strong>two action buttons are Jump and Boost</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Jump is used to make your car jump towards the direction your car&rsquo;s roof is facing</strong>. The Jump can be used two times consecutively after leaving the ground whereas Boost allows your car to move at an accelerated speed until the boost gauge is depleted.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">However, for complex techniques, you need to make use of both of these action buttons consecutively and sometimes together. This might be a challenge for players who use two fingers to play mobile games. But there is another button hidden in the game settings that allow you to jump and boost at the same time.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The<strong>&nbsp;Jump-Boost button can be unlocked by entering the game settings from the top right corner</strong>&nbsp;of the game home screen and pressing Configure. Afterward, you will see a Red button which you have to click and check the Enabled option. You can also move the buttons and arrange them according to your comfort.</p>
