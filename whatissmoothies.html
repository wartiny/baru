<p style="text-align: center;">A&nbsp;<em>smoothie</em>&nbsp;(also spelled&nbsp;<em>smoothy</em>) is a thick blended beverage with shake like consistency, normally pureed in a blender containing fruits and/or vegetables as well as an added liquid such as fruit juice, vegetable juice, milk, or even yogurt.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Smoothies Have 3 Main Parts</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Traditionally, most smoothies consist of three parts: some type of liquid (often called the "base" of the smoothie), an assortment of fruits and/or vegetables, and ice. If frozen fruit or vegetables are used, the cool temperature can be achieved without using ice.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Thickness and Optional Ingredients</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">The "thickness" of a smoothie is usually determined by the ratio of liquids to solids, so to thicken any smoothie recipe you can generally reduce the amount of added liquid or conversely increase the amount of added fruit or vegetables. Optionally, some people add powders to a smoothie for additional supplementation and flavoring which also increases the thickness. An example of this is flavored protein powder or vitamin supplements.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Toppings, Garnishes, and Appearance</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">Garnishes such as fresh mint leaves and partially chopped or whole fruit like lemon wedges or slices are increasingly being used to decorate smoothies in recipes. The marketing of smoothies has led to this "dressing up" to make them look more attractive in advertising and overall more aesthetically appealing.</p>
