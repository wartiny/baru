<p style="text-align: center;">One of the most iconic stunts and freestyling techniques is to make your car spin. Although it may look difficult, it will become natural with practice. The way to do a spin is by aiming upwards or any direction that is angled upwards and then booting up to get off the ground. When you are off the ground, let go of your joystick but immediately grab it again in an upwards direction and then maneuver to whichever direction you please.</p>
