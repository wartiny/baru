<h2><strong>Use the Skateboard in Pizza Missions</strong></h2>
<p>In the pizza mission, you must deliver pizzas to all customers within the stipulated time as shown by the timer on the left side of the screen.</p>
<p>But delivering pizza from one customer to another takes time, especially when they are far away from each other. No worries! There&rsquo;s a nice little trick to deliver pizzas fast. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>Finish all beginner missions from Ms. Info at the plaza to get the yellow skateboard as a free reward.</p>
<p>Take up the pizza mission, tap the red backpack on the right side of the screen, go to the &ldquo;Vehicles&rdquo; section on the bag. Now, tap on the skateboard to equip it to your avatar.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! Ride the streets of the plaza to deliver pizzas faster than before.</p>
<p>You can purchase new skateboards and even bikes from the Skater. Find him near the skatepark, next to the ghost house in the plaza.</p>
