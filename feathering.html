<p style="text-align: center;">One of the amateur mistakes most players make is not utilizing their boost properly, they tend to just hold the boost button for almost all of their movement. Ideally, your car should be having a boost continuously but not by holding on to the boost button. You should feather your boost by rapidly clicking the boost button instead of holding it. This would give you sufficient time to readjust your movement direction and give a small window of time for the boost gauge to regenerate. Since you will be in the air, it will seem as if your boost gauge is higher than everyone else&rsquo;s.</p>
