<h2>Entering the Lobby</h2>
<p>Once you have the Blue hand head back to the reception area. Jump over the turn-style by the front desk to reach a door with a blue hand above it. Shoot your blue hand at the switch to open the door. This door leads you to the factory and the real start of the scary section of the game.</p>
<h2>Playtime Lobby</h2>
<p>Inside the lobby you will see a few interesting things. The first, and most prominent, is the large toy creature named Huggy Wuggy in the center of the room. Huggy Wuggy is the toy that chases you throughout this chapter. The second thing you will notice is that there are seven doors in this room. These doors lead to different areas of the factory.</p>
<p>Before going through any of the doors we need to grab the<strong>&nbsp;Yellow Power Room Key</strong>&nbsp;dangling from the giant toys hand using your blue hand. To do this shoot the blue hand door to the left. The door won&rsquo;t open because it has no power. When you do this the Yellow Key will drop into the creatures upraised hand. Use your hand to grab it.</p>
<p>Once you have the Yellow Key make your way to the door labelled Power. Go through the doors and into the Power generating room. Inside this room we need to get the power back up and running.</p>
