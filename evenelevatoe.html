<h2 class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">Open The Elevator Doors</h2>
<p class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">Run back to the front of your house and pick up the shoe lying in the pile of random objects. Head to the back of your neighbor&rsquo;s house until you find a&nbsp;big wooden post with the white vent hanging off it. This is the elevator shaft.&nbsp;Position yourself so you can see the switch inside the vent and throw the shoe at the switch to trigger it. This will open the elevator doors that were previously shut inside your neighbor's house.</p>
<p class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">If you miss your first attempt, which you probably will, there are more shoes inside of the house. You'll find 4 of them as soon as you walk through the front door and look to the right. If you do go inside the house for shoes, grab the umbrella leaning against the wall because this will come into good use in a bit.</p>
