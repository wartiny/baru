<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Complete all Beginner Quests</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Once you have created your avatar, it&rsquo;s time to get a list of basic missions from Ms. Info.</strong></p>
<p>The manager will show you the way to Ms. Info&rsquo;s cubicle at the &ldquo;Info Center&rdquo;. There you will receive a list of quests. As a bonus, you will also receive 100 stars for reaching Ms. Info.</p>
<p>Tap the beginner missions&rsquo; sticky note on the top left to check all seven basic quests. Some of these quests grant stars as rewards, not all though.</p>
<p>Press the &ldquo;navigate&rdquo; button beside each quest to know its location in the plaza. The plaza is in Kaia Island, and this is where most of the action takes place, i.e. earning stars.</p>
<p>After pressing the navigate button, follow the arrow on the ground to reach your mission destination.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>You can skip all missions by clicking on &ldquo;complete now&rdquo; below a mission and still get your rewards. Watch a video and complete a mission. I won&rsquo;t recommend doing this as you will miss an important part of the tutorial if you skip all missions. These basic quests are part of the tutorial and you will learn a lot of new activities if you complete them one by one.</p>
<p>When you complete a mission, you will receive rewards in the form of stars and crowns. Finishing all basic missions grant a special reward &ndash; You will receive a cool skateboard that will make moving from one destination to another a bit faster.</p>
