<h1>Npcs</h1>
<p>After adding some props into the room you should add some Npcs into the room as well&hellip;<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Since I have 2 chairs in this room, I will add 2 Npcs into the room!<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Now spawn the Npcs into the room.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />While you do this unpause time and place the npcs on top of the chairs&hellip;</p>
<p>After that hold the left-mouse button and highlight both of them.<br />&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />Then right click and scroll down and then you should see a button called sit.</p>
<p>Click the button and it should position them into a sitting position</p>
<p>After that freeze both of them and proceed to Section 4&hellip;</p>
