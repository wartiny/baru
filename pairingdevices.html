<p style="text-align: center;">Launching the Manufacturer's App and Pairing the Devices</p>
<p>Now that you're connected to the camera's WiFi network, open the manufacturer's app you downloaded earlier. Launching the app will automatically detect the camera's presence on the network. You may be prompted to enter a unique identification number or scan a QR code to pair the camera with your phone. Once the pairing process is complete, you should see a live view of what the camera is capturing on your phone's screen.</p>
