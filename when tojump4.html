<h3 style="text-align: center;">4. When To Jump Should Be Based On Expertise</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">One of the staple aspects of every battle royale game relates to how players are deployed into the battle arena. Just like conventional ones, Sausage Man sets you off to jump out of a moving aircraft. Another random element in each match presents itself during this phase as the path and direction of the aircraft you and all other players jump from, vary from one match to the next. What is consistent about it is that the path will always cut across the map.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Even with this random element, there is still strategic planning to be held before the start of each match and, to a great respect, should be tied up to you and your team&rsquo;s level of expertise. Regardless of which way the aircraft travels, your decision on when to jump off the aircraft should not be a random activity but, rather, based on your plan of action or strategy within the match.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">In general, there are basically 2 extreme points to consider. The first is to jump off as early as possible and the other option is to exercise more patience and wait for the final moments of the aircraft travel before you jump off of it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The early birds catch the worm, so they say, and in the case of Sausage Man as well as most battle royale games, jumping off the craft ahead of the pack means an earlier touchdown. This ultimately leads to a high probability of getting weapons and items first, giving you a solid advantage over everyone else that comes second or even later.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The early birds, in this case, will unfortunately have to contend with numerous other early birds. Some of these players may actually just be reckless, or some are pros who are confident enough of their skills to want to get to the battle arena that fast.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">For the most part, the decision to jump off ahead of the pack is best left for the more experienced or veteran players given that the chances of quick encounters are high and the risk of being disadvantaged in terms of arms and weaponry is equally high as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">As far as jumping targets go, jumping off the craft as soon as you are able to or earlier rather than later, means that you will choose to land on the areas with buildings or structures. As these spots have more weapons and items in them, jumping down towards a rather desolate area of the map will certainly leave you at a disadvantage in case of an encounter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">On the other extreme end of considerations, there is also an option to jump off at a later time as the aircraft travels towards the end of its route. You may notice that there are less players who choose to go this way and you might even find yourself to actually be the last man standing as far as diving down the battle arena is concerned.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">While the early birds or, in this case the early jumpers, are already at each other&rsquo;s throats on the other end of the map, you can have a bit of liberty to scrounge for weapons and items without much risk. There is still a chance to encounter some enemies even if you chose to jump off late, but it is highly unlikely.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Of course, you should always keep watch of players jumping off and never stop looking around as you make the drop towards the map. Going for a late jump is naturally more suitable for beginners as well as cautious yet experienced players. We recommend going for this until after you have gained enough experience and confidence to go for a riskier maneuver.</p>
