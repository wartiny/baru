<h3 style="text-align: center;">Escaping the police without taking damage</h3>
<p>If the police are after you, lead them to a corner, where one is in front of the other, or stand behind one of the officers. If one shoots another, the other will attack back, and you will no longer be their objective. If one kills the other, additional police will go after them and you will have successfully escaped death.</p>
