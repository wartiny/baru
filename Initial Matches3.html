<h3 style="text-align: center;">3. Consider The Initial Matches As Practice Session Extensions</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Having the perfect control settings and button layout as well as raising your level of familiarity with every weapon and item in Sausage Man definitely gives you an edge in your starting matches. There are still plenty of things you can only learn from an actual match and like everyone else, you cannot expect to instantly be a top performer on your initial set of battles.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Learning to move about and shoot, as you will discover in the super short tutorial session, is far from the tip of the iceberg here. Tinkering with the different settings and spending time in training runs are closer to what an actual initiation ought to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Sausage Man is truly a game that is easy to learn but difficult to master and yet, there is fun to revel in from the start of your first match with other players. If you followed the above tips and strategies, you should already feel that you already know a lot at this point. There is still much to unravel in Sausage Man, and most of it comes from actual battle experience.</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full">On the initial sets of matches you engage in, one of the major details you need to pay attention to is the map layout itself. There are currently only 2 maps in Sausage Man and the basic mode allows you to choose either one or go with a random map. Although 2 maps seem easy to familiarize yourself with, each battle arena map in Sausage Man is extraordinarily humongous, even by battle royale standards. It will certainly take a while and a lot of repeat matches before you grow your familiarity with each one.</figure>

<p style="text-align: center;">You do not necessarily have to memorize every detail and every corner of each map. A good enough understanding of where structures and lumps of structures are as well as where wide open spaces are available should already be enough. Its importance, of course, relates to the strategies you need to put in place in accordance with where you are most likely be situated after the jump. Naturally, having a good overall sense of its general layout means you can do well enough to hold your own wherever you and your team wind up in as the match ensues.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Knowing plenty of good places is key to raising chances of victory in every match. There are plenty of random elements in play as you engage in a match in Sausage Man and you are likely to find yourself in different locations with every match, even within one. Potential hiding spots or covers as well as entry and exit points on the more structured areas can give you an advantage in every encounter.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Another key point you cannot learn from the tutorial and training sessions are the exact location of loots to arm yourself with after the big drop. Surely enough, part of random element in the game comes from how the weapons and items are shuffled and scattered but you can be certain enough that there will always be something to loot and arm yourself with on specific locations. You can expect that some areas will potentially have more items to loot than others and likewise has a higher probability to invite more people on them.</p>
