<h2 class="tmpl-el" style="text-align: center;">Turn on the Generator</h2>
<p class="tmpl-el size-m alt" style="text-align: center;">Before you do anything, make sure you run to the left side of the house where you&rsquo;ll find a closed fuse box. Open it and pull the lever to shut off the electricity. This will keep your neighbor from being able to use the elevator and any cameras while you're running around trying to get into his basement.</p>
<p class="tmpl-el size-m alt" style="text-align: center;">After you've done that, keep moving past the fuse box to the open window with a cable running out of it. There will be a generator in there. Push the big red button from outside the window. Not quite sure what this powers but it might come in handy.</p>
