<h2>Red Light, Green Light</h2>
<p>The first round in the game (and the most infamous, thanks to the giant singing robot doll) sees the 456 contestants having to run across a field and cross a white line where the robot doll is standing, all within a five minute time limit. Those who fail to make it across in time are killed.</p>
<p>The twist of the game is that players can only move when the robot has her back turned to the contestants, which they herald by shouting &lsquo;green light&rsquo;. When the robot shouts red light, and spins around to face the crowd, the contestants all have to freeze. If they are caught moving, or even hesitating, the robot&rsquo;s motion detectors kick in, and the eyes (which double up as machine guns) shoot to kill (or in some cases, obliterate).</p>
<p>The round is based on the playground game of the same name, but it is also called &lsquo;Statues&rsquo; or &lsquo;Grandmother&rsquo;s Footsteps&rsquo; in the UK. In a similar fashion, a person starts out as the &ldquo;Curator&rdquo; (It, Granny, Pooh, etc.) and stands at the end of a field. Everyone else playing stands at the far end (distance depends upon playing area selected). The object of the game is for a &ldquo;Statue&rdquo; to tag the Curator, thereby becoming the Curator and resetting the game.</p>
